# How will it work?

The various stages of the projects have tests of their own that ensure that there is not mistake in the actual run of the project.

The tests are:

1. The first test is a basic test on RSS feeds that ensures-
	a) all RSS feeds are defined and are not empty
	b) all the feeds are defined and have URL
	c) all the feeds are defined and have name

2. The second test is a test for the menu button which checks that-
	a) the menu element is hidden by default
	b) the menu shows when clicked and hides on double click

3. The third test is a test for the initial entries on the page that checks whether-
	a) the feed has at least one entry when loaded

4. The fourth test is a test on the selection of new feed that ensures-
	a) all the entries/feeds are unique
